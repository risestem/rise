# RISE Website 🚀

Welcome to the official README for the RISE website—built on hopes, dreams, and just a *tiny* bit of actual code. This project is designed to showcase and support **Rise Engineering & Coding**, an initiative dedicated to providing free STEM education to middle school students across Atlanta. Through hands-on projects and mentorship, we aim to inspire the next generation of engineers and coders.

## ✨ How It Works

1. **User-Friendly Interface** – We make sure users don’t need a PhD in Computer Science to navigate the site. 
2. **Fast & Responsive** – Thanks to Tailwind CSS, this site loads faster than your morning caffeine kicks in.
3. **Optimized for All Devices** – Whether you're on a high-end desktop or a potato-powered laptop, the experience is smooth (not really).

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Tailwind CSS** – Making CSS bearable since forever.
- **Flowbite** – Carried me through CSS elements 🙏.
- **Blood, sweat, and debugging** – Because coding is 90% fixing things that *should* work.

## 📢 About RISE Engineering & Coding

**Who We Are:**
RISE (Reinventing, Innovation, STEM, and Education) is a group of three students passionate about empowering students with free access to STEM education. Through hands-on projects and mentorship, we aim to inspire the next generation of engineers and coders.

**Our Team:**
- **Brayden Watt** – A Junior at the Westminster Schools who loves robotics, Science Olympiad, and mentoring younger students.
- **Joshua Luo** – An eleventh grader passionate about robotics, gardening, swimming, and coding in multiple languages.
- **Enpeng Jiang** – A Junior active in FRC, Science Olympiad, Science Bowl, and Swim Team, excited about applying engineering concepts.

**Our Mission:**
Rise Engineering & Coding was founded to provide free STEM education to middle school students across Atlanta. We believe that early exposure to engineering and coding concepts can inspire the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers.

## 🐛 Bugs & Feature Requests

If you find a bug, congrats! You’re now part of the development team. Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. If you have a feature request, drop it in the issues—just know that it might be implemented based on the alignment of the stars. ⭐

## 🎉 Contributing

PRs are welcome! Just make sure your code is cleaner than my room (which, to be fair, is not a high bar). Follow the existing coding style and comment your code (because future-you will thank you).

## 📜 License

This project is open source because sharing is caring. Feel free to use, modify, or break it (please don’t). Just don’t forget to give credit where credit is due!

### 🚀 Special Thanks
This project was crafted with way too little experience, the occasional existential crisis, and the unwavering support of ChatGPT, which carried me through every bug, every syntax error, and every "why isn't this working?!" moment. If it works, thank me. If it breaks, let's just call it an "AI-assisted learning experience." 😉

Happy coding! 🚀
