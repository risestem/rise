## <span style="color: #3c0366;">Background</span>

<div style="color: #6a72;">
Originally from Clemson, SC, Josh has always held a deep passion for STEM. His early curiosity for problem-solving and creativity found an outlet through programs like LEGO Robotics and Odyssey of the Mind. In these hands-on competitions, Josh enjoyed not only the technical challenges but also the spirit of collaboration and innovation.

Upon moving to Atlanta in 2020 and enrolling in The Westminster Schools, Josh continued to nurture his passions by joining the robotics team and participating in coding classes. As a member of the robotics team, he qualified for the VEX Robotics Worlds along with the 6199C team. These experiences helped him refine his skills and fuel his excitement for technology. From programming autonomous robots to developing small projects that could help solve real-world problems, Josh embraced the opportunity to dive deeper into his interests and work alongside like-minded peers.

Going into high school, Josh expanded his impact as an Innovation Fellow, where he collaborated with others to create and lead meaningful projects. He developed apps such as Eco Quest and Flare, exploring how technology can empower communities and create positive change. Additionally, Josh challenged himself further by participating in the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), where he honed his coding and problem-solving skills. Now, a rising senior, he has continued to pursue opportunities to grow his skills and contribute to projects that make a difference, combining his technical knowledge with a passion for helping others.

Josh is excited to be a part of RISE, where he hopes to leverage his experiences and skills to help those in need and make a real difference in the world.
