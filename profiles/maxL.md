## Background

Max Lin grew up in New Orleans, a city known for its rich culture and lively atmosphere. When he moved to Atlanta in 7th grade, he found a welcoming community at Westminster Schools, where he quickly immersed himself in new activities and challenges.

Max has always had a strong affinity for analytical thinking and teamwork. As a dedicated member of the math team, he enjoys tackling complex problems and collaborating with his peers to find creative solutions. His passion for numbers also extends to his work in the investment club, where he’s constantly learning about the world of finance and economics.

Outside of academics, Max is an accomplished swimmer, balancing rigorous practices with his academic pursuits. He’s also a lead in Mooncakes, an affinity group that fosters cultural connections and understanding within the school community. Through these experiences, Max has honed his ability to lead, motivate, and inspire those around him.

Now, Max is excited to bring his multifaceted talents to RISE. He’s particularly eager to help design creative curriculum that engages students and sparks their curiosity. Whether it’s crafting activities that combine math, finance, and real-world problem-solving or weaving in elements of cultural awareness and collaboration, Max is ready to contribute his energy and ideas to RISE’s mission.
