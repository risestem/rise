## <span style="color: #a78bfa;">Background</span>

Enpeng Jiang's story begins in Tallahassee, Florida, where he was born in 2008. His early years were marked by significant geographical transitions that would shape his worldview and adaptability. During his childhood, Enpeng spent a formative year living in China, an experience that exposed him to different cultures and educational approaches. Eventually, his family settled in Atlanta, Georgia, where he would find his academic home and pursue his passion for science.

When Enpeng arrived at The Westminster Schools as a middle school student, he quickly immersed himself in the school's robust STEM programs. He joined the robotics team, where he discovered his love for hands-on engineering and collaborative problem-solving. This early exposure to practical application of scientific principles ignited a passion that would drive his academic pursuits throughout his school years.

As a member of Westminster's class of 2026, Enpeng has excelled in multiple academic competitions. He helped the Science Bowl team qualify for nationals and competes in Academic Quiz Tournament, demonstrating his broad knowledge across subjects. His most notable achievements are in Science Olympiad, where his Earth Science expertise earned him spots at the United States Earth Science Olympiad (USESO) camp for two consecutive years, placing him among the nation's top young Earth Science scholars.

Enpeng's diverse experiences and academic success have instilled in him a strong desire to give back to his community. Recognizing the opportunities he has had throughout his educational journey, he is committed to helping others discover their own passion for STEM through organizations like RISE and other nonprofit initiatives, hoping to inspire the next generation of young scientists and engineers.
