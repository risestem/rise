# RISE-ing During Summer Camp

RISE STEM recently wrapped up its first full summer camp, bringing four days of hands-on STEM learning to over 20 middle 
schoolers at the [Agape Youth & Family Center](https://agapeatlanta.org/). Each day focused on a different branch of engineering—civil, mechanical, 
chemical, and aerospace—through creative challenges like building bridges, launching gliders, and experimenting with 
water electrolysis. Students explored key concepts like friction, center of gravity, and lift while gaining confidence 
and curiosity in STEM. RISE STEM is continuing its mission this fall with an after-school camp, one-day workshops, and
the launch of [RISE Kits](https://github.com/risestem/stem-kits) to expand access to DIY engineering experiences.
