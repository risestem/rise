RISE officialy leapt into action, hosting a workshop in collaboration with Agape. RISE workers engaged with the students to build foundational engineering skills, such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. The students participated in an activity where they had to divide into groups of two. One student would be able to observe a structure made of legos and write down what they see, while the other student must reconstruct the structure based soley on their partner's instructions. Through the course of this activity, students not only had fun engaging with the activity but also reinforced their core skills.
